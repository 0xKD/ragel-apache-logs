ragel-apache-logs
=================

A sample project using Ragel to generate a tokenizer for Apache log files

This project is a companion to an [Emcien engineering blog](https://engineering.emcien.com/) post. Feel free to read the comments in the code here (parser.rl is a good starting point), but you may find it easier to follow along with the blog post.
